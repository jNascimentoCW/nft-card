A challenge from Frontend Mentor - A responsive NFT card page

This is an exercise from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

The goal was to build a NFT card looking as close as I could from the image and work thinking in a responsive way.

I also got to practice centering divs and elements besides how to use the pseudo-class :hover on images.
